A key-based encryption application made in python

### Note To Contest Coordinators
Here's my [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-DQ7SvZmsEzWEQORfxAdbvOeZctS5SPlMCtUKY-Bgd0/edit?usp=sharing) detailing some giccups I ran into during development.

## Purpose
This was made for a coding contest. It's meant to take input files/text and encode/decode them with key files.
Byte files can also be encoded/decoded (PNG, EXE, JPG, etc)

## Usage instructions
Run main.py with Python 3.
